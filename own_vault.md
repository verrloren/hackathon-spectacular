Want to try out in your own vault? You can do so by following these steps:
1. Go to your (development) obsidian vault.
2. Find the dotfiles folder with all the configs. Typically name `.obsidian`
3. Go to the plugin folder here. This is typically named `plugins`. If you have not installed any plugins, this folder might not exist.
4. Copy the folder `demo_vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-copilot` into your own plugins folder.

You can now make changes to the plugin and test them locally.
If your changes could benefit others, feel free to submit a pull request.
