Bitcoin is a new kind of digital money. It differs from other types of digital money because it works without a central authority and without intermediaries such as banks. Instead, it is an open and decentralized network, where users are in control. The network is spread all over the world and anyone can participate.
  
Bitcoin works differently than most people are used to due to the underlying technology. To fully understand it you will have to study it for a while.

For those who want to know a little more, we have written the technical explanation below. Not enough to call yourself a bitcoin expert, but perhaps enough to make an impression in the pub.
